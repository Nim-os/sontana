# sontana
Sontana is a game engine made to supplement and abstract the [Minueto framework](http://minueto.cs.mcgill.ca/).\
This library provides a more human-like approach to game development by solving most of the gritty game-dev problems like memory management, game loop, etc whilst maintaining an exposed view of Minueto.

All code is documented and easily modifiable for flexibility. You can find information for each of the classes used in development in guide.pdf.

## Requirements
 - [Minueto 2.0](http://minueto.cs.mcgill.ca/index.html#download)
 - Java 11 or newer

## How To
 - Place the library in the same folder as Minueto.
